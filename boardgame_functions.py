You have to navigate through the game board and have a selection of cards\n\
available to choose from. These determine how many steps you can take\n\
thrpugh the board. Take it in turns moving through the board, picking up\n\
the beads along the way. There are Rubies, Diamonds, Emeralds, Sapphires\n\
and glass beads. If you collect Glass beads you loose points everything else\n\
you gain points for. The game carries on until the marker moves of the board\n\
and whoever made the last move gets a bonus point.')
